## Welcome!

Welcome, developers! In this secret (shhh) part of the website you'll find some documentation on how the
website works.

{% include tip.html content="You may want to bookmark this page so you can easily find it in the future" %}

## Overview

This website uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. The site is hosted by GitHub Pages.

## Set Up for Local Testing

Modifying the website, committing changes, and waiting for GitHub pages to regenerate the site is awfully slow.
You should definitely set up Jekyll for local testing. As of now, Jekyll doesn't seem to support local testing
on Windows machines.

### 1. Install Ruby

Visit the [Jekyll installation page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and follow the steps there.

### 2. Install the Jekyll Gem
Run the command:

```bash
$ gem install jekyll bundler
```

If you're unsure of where to begin, you should check out Jekyll.
